Such as orphan options, orphan tables, and orphan cron tasks. As you may know, not all plugins\\/themes care about the housekeeping of your WordPress database. As long as you are removing plugins\\/themes, leftovers will be accumulated in your database and will influence your website performance. The Pro version of Advanced Database Cleaner will help you remove all those leftovers and perform a deep database clean up. In the pro version you can:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Classify options according to their &quot;creator&quot;. They can be either: plugins options, themes options or WP core options<\\/li>\\n<li>Detect and delete orphan options. Your \'wp_options\' table may be full of orphaned options and therefore can impact the performance of loading data from it, which may lead to a slow website. Clean up orphaned options is then important<\\/li>\\n<li>Classify tables according to their &quot;creator&quot;. They can be either: plugins tables, themes tables or WP core tables<\\/li>\\n<li>Detect and delete orphan tables. As for options, you may also have some orphaned tables that were created by plugins\\/themes you are not using anymore. Clean up orphaned tables will decrease the size of your database<\\/li>\\n<li>Classify all cron tasks (cron jobs) according to their &quot;creator&quot;. They can be either: plugins cron tasks, themes cron tasks or WP core tasks<\\/li>\\n<li>Detect and delete orphan cron jobs. After you uninstall a plugin\\/theme, some of its cron tasks may still be active making WordPress calling unknown functions. using the pro version, you can detect and clean orphaned tasks<\\/li>\\n<li>Search &amp; filter options, filter tables and filter cron tasks based on several criteria such as the &quot;name&quot;, &quot;creator&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, etc.<\\/li>\\n<li>Get premium support: we will provide quick support as well as any technical answers to help you clean up your database efficiently<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> Translations <\\/h4>\\n<p>You are welcome to contribute to the plugin translation via the <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/translate.wordpress.org\\/projects\\/wp-plugins\\/advanced-database-cleaner\\">WordPress translation website<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<h4> Thanks To <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https:\\/\\/profiles.wordpress.org\\/fabiofava\\">Fabio Fava<\\/a> for translating the plugin to pt_BR<\\/li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https:\\/\\/profiles.wordpress.org\\/juliobox\\">Julio Potier<\\/a> for the security remarks<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>","changelog":"<h4> 3.2.1 - 24\\/06\\/2022 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Security fix: enhancing the security of the plugin by escaping some URLs before outputting them<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.2.0 - 16\\/06\\/2022 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fix: fixing the error \'Fatal error: Can\'t use function return value in write context\'<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: fixing the Warning: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: correcting of some typos and grammar<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: deleting some useless data from &quot;overview &amp; settings&quot; tab<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing the CSS code, the plugin is responsive now and can be used in small screens<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing some blocks of PHP code<\\/li>\\n<li>New: adding \\u201cdelete filter\\u201d for custom cleanup elements in \\u201cgeneral cleanup\\u201d tab<\\/li>\\n<li>Info: since we have changed a lot of CSS code, please refresh your browser cache or click &quot;Ctrl + F5&quot;<\\/li>\\n<li>Info: great feature will be added to the next version<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.7 - 21\\/01\\/2022 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Tweak: Enhancing the security of the plugin<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: Tested with the latest versions of WP<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.6 - 06\\/10\\/2020 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Tweak: Cleaning the code by deleting unused blocks of code<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: Enhancing the security of the plugin<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.5 - 04\\/09\\/2020 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fix: an issue of timeout that occurs when scanning items is now fixed<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: some calls in JS file has been corrected<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: fixing an issue in the general cleanup tab preventing users from deleting orphaned items on WP 5.5<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: the warning &quot;Deprecated: array_key_exists()&quot; is now solved<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: deleting two scan files generated by the plugin to enhance security<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: we are now using SweetAlert for all popup boxes<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing the JavaScript code<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing some blocks of code<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing the security of the plugin<\\/li>\\n<li>New: you can now scan individual items besides scanning all items<\\/li>\\n<li>New: you can now edit the categorization of items and correct it manually if needed<\\/li>\\n<li>New great features are coming very soon!<\\/li>\\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.5<\\/li>\\n<li>(Note: When upgrading to this new version, please make sure to clear your browser cache)<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.0 - 04\\/12\\/2019 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fix: In some previous versions, tables were not shown for some users.

We do not run any code that can break down your site or delete your posts, pages, comments, etc. However, make sure to always back up your database before any cleanup. This is not optional; it is required! It is always better to be safe than sorry!<\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Optimize my database\\"?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Optimizing your database will reclaim unused space in your tables, which will reduce storage space and improve efficiency when accessing tables. Optimizing the database can sometimes significantly improve performance, particularly on sites that receive a lot of traffic or have a large amount of content. Optimizing your database is absolutely safe.<\\/p>\\n<h4>Is it safe to clean the cron (scheduled tasks)?<\\/h4>\\n<p>A scheduled task enables plugins to execute some actions at specified times, without having to manually execute code at that time. Wordpress itself uses some scheduled tasks to perform some regular actions. However, some scheduled tasks may not be removed even if the responsible plugins are deleted from your WordPress installation. As you know, not all plugins care about the housekeeping of your WordPress. Hence, deleting these unnecessary tasks may help in cleaning your site. It should be noted that cleaning scheduled tasks is safe as long as you know what tasks to clean. If you are not sure, it is better to not clean any task.<\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Revision\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>WordPress stores a record (called &quot;revision&quot;) of each saved draft or published update. This system allows you to see what changes were made in each post and page over time. However, this can lead to a lot of unnecessary overhead in your WordPress database, which consumes a lot of space. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all revisions is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_type = \'revision\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Auto-draft\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Wordpress automatically saves your post\\/page while you are editing it. This is called an auto-draft. If you don\'t hit the publish\\/update button, then the post\\/page will be saved as auto-draft and any modification to your post\\/page will not be visible in your public site. Over time, you could have multiple auto-drafts that you will never publish and hence you can clean them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all auto-drafts is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_status = \'auto-draft\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Pending comment\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Pending comments are comments published by users and which are waiting for your approval before appearing in your site. In some cases, you will have to clean all these comments. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all pending comments is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = \'0\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Spam comment\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>It is a comment that you (or a plugin) have marked as spam. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all spam comments is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = \'spam\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Trash comment\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>A trash comment is a comment that you have deleted from your Wordpress and have been moved to the trash. A trash comment is not visible in your site and should be deleted forever. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all trash comments is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = \'trash\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"trackback\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Trackbacks allows you to notify other websites owners that you have linked to their article on your website. These trackbacks can be used to send huge amounts of spam. Spammers use them to get their links posted on as many sites as possible. That is why they should be deactivated\\/cleaned if you do not use them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean trackbacks is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = \'trackback\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"pingback\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Pingbacks allow you to notify other websites owners that you have linked to their article on your website. Pingbacks were designed to solve some of the problems that people saw with trackbacks. Although there are some minor technical differences, a trackback is basically the same things as a pingback. These pingbacks can be used to send huge amounts of spam. Spammers use them to get their links posted on as many sites as possible. That is why they should be deactivated\\/cleaned if you do not use them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean pingbacks is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = \'pingback\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan post meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The post meta data is the information you provide to viewers about each post. This information usually includes the author of the post, when it was written (or posted), and how the author categorized that particular post. In some cases, some post meta data information becomes orphan and does not belong to any post. They are then called &quot;orphan postmeta&quot; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan postmeta is:\\n<code>DELETE pm FROM postmeta pm LEFT JOIN posts wp ON wp.ID = pm.post_id WHERE wp.ID IS NULL<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan comment meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The same as &quot;Orphan post meta&quot; with the exception that &quot;orphan comment meta&quot; concern comments and not posts. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM commentmeta WHERE comment_id NOT IN (SELECT comment_id FROM comments)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan user meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The user meta data is the information you provide to viewers about each user. This information usually includes additional data that is not stored in the users table of WordPress. In some cases, some user meta data information becomes orphaned and does not belong to any user. They are then called &quot;orphaned usermeta&quot; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM usermeta WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM users)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan term meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The term meta data is the information that is provided for each taxonomy term. This information usually includes additional data that is not stored in the terms table of WordPress. In some cases, some term meta data information becomes orphaned and does not belong to any taxonomy term. They are then called &quot;orphaned termmeta&quot; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM termmeta WHERE term_id NOT IN (SELECT term_id FROM terms)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan relationships\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Sometimes the wp_term_relationships table becomes bloated with many orphaned relationships. This happens particularly often if you\\u2019re using your site not as a blog but as some other type of content site where posts are deleted periodically. Over time, you could get thousands of term relationships for posts that no longer exist which consumes a lot of database space. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan relationships is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM term_relationships WHERE term_taxonomy_id=1 AND object_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM posts)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"expired transient\\"?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Transients are a way of storing cached data in the WordPress DB temporarily by giving it a name and a time frame after which it will expire and be deleted. This helps improve WordPress performance and speed up your website while reducing the overall server load. Expired transients are transients that are expired and still exist in the database. These ones can be safely cleaned. Transients housekeeping is now part of WordPress core, as of version 4.9, so no need to clean up them manually unless you have specific needs.<\\/p>\\n<h4>Is this plugin compatible with multisite?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Yes, it is compatible with multisite. It should be noted that only the main site in the network can clean the database and orphan items of all the network. We prevent other sites to clean your DB since we believe that only the super administrator has the right to perform such operation. Your database is precious!<\\/p>\\n<h4>Is this plugin compatible with SharDB, HyperDB or Multi-DB?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Actually the plugin is not supposed to be compatible with SharDB, HyperDB or Multi-DB. We will try to make it compatible in the coming releases.<\\/p>\\n<h4>Does this plugin cleans itself after the uninstall?<\\/h4>\\n<p>We do clean-up of your WordPress site, it will be a shame if the plugin does not clean itself after an uninstall! Of course yes, the plugin cleans itself and removes any data used to store its settings once uninstalled.<\\/p>\\n"},"banners":{"high":"","low":""},"icons":{"1x":"https:\\/\\/sigmaplugin.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/edd\\/2017\\/01\\/wordpress-advanced-database-cleaner-plugin.jpg","2x":"https:\\/\\/sigmaplugin.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/edd\\/2017\\/01\\/wordpress-advanced-database-cleaner-plugin.jpg"},"msg":"No license key has been provided.","stable_tag":"3.2.1","donate_link":"https:\\/\\/www.sigmaplugin.com\\/donation","license":"GPLv2 or later","tested":"6.1","description":["<p>Clean up database by deleting orphaned items such as \'old revisions\', \'spam comments\', optimize database and more...<\\/p>\\n<p>If you have been using WordPress for a while, then you should think absolutely about a database cleanup.

Such as orphan options, orphan tables, and orphan cron tasks. As you may know, not all plugins\\/themes care about the housekeeping of your WordPress database. As long as you are removing plugins\\/themes, leftovers will be accumulated in your database and will influence your website performance. The Pro version of Advanced Database Cleaner will help you remove all those leftovers and perform a deep database clean up. In the pro version you can:<\\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Classify options according to their &quot;creator&quot;. They can be either: plugins options, themes options or WP core options<\\/li>\\n<li>Detect and delete orphan options. Your \'wp_options\' table may be full of orphaned options and therefore can impact the performance of loading data from it, which may lead to a slow website. Clean up orphaned options is then important<\\/li>\\n<li>Classify tables according to their &quot;creator&quot;. They can be either: plugins tables, themes tables or WP core tables<\\/li>\\n<li>Detect and delete orphan tables. As for options, you may also have some orphaned tables that were created by plugins\\/themes you are not using anymore. Clean up orphaned tables will decrease the size of your database<\\/li>\\n<li>Classify all cron tasks (cron jobs) according to their &quot;creator&quot;. They can be either: plugins cron tasks, themes cron tasks or WP core tasks<\\/li>\\n<li>Detect and delete orphan cron jobs. After you uninstall a plugin\\/theme, some of its cron tasks may still be active making WordPress calling unknown functions. using the pro version, you can detect and clean orphaned tasks<\\/li>\\n<li>Search &amp; filter options, filter tables and filter cron tasks based on several criteria such as the &quot;name&quot;, &quot;creator&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, etc.<\\/li>\\n<li>Get premium support: we will provide quick support as well as any technical answers to help you clean up your database efficiently<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> Translations <\\/h4>\\n<p>You are welcome to contribute to the plugin translation via the <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/translate.wordpress.org\\/projects\\/wp-plugins\\/advanced-database-cleaner\\">WordPress translation website<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<h4> Thanks To <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\"https:\\/\\/profiles.wordpress.org\\/fabiofava\\">Fabio Fava<\\/a> for translating the plugin to pt_BR<\\/li>\\n<li><a href=\\"https:\\/\\/profiles.wordpress.org\\/juliobox\\">Julio Potier<\\/a> for the security remarks<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>"],"changelog":["<h4> 3.2.1 - 24\\/06\\/2022 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Security fix: enhancing the security of the plugin by escaping some URLs before outputting them<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.2.0 - 16\\/06\\/2022 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fix: fixing the error \'Fatal error: Can\'t use function return value in write context\'<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: fixing the Warning: count(): Parameter must be an array or an object that implements Countable<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: correcting of some typos and grammar<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: deleting some useless data from &quot;overview &amp; settings&quot; tab<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing the CSS code, the plugin is responsive now and can be used in small screens<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing some blocks of PHP code<\\/li>\\n<li>New: adding \\u201cdelete filter\\u201d for custom cleanup elements in \\u201cgeneral cleanup\\u201d tab<\\/li>\\n<li>Info: since we have changed a lot of CSS code, please refresh your browser cache or click &quot;Ctrl + F5&quot;<\\/li>\\n<li>Info: great feature will be added to the next version<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.7 - 21\\/01\\/2022 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Tweak: Enhancing the security of the plugin<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: Tested with the latest versions of WP<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.6 - 06\\/10\\/2020 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Tweak: Cleaning the code by deleting unused blocks of code<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: Enhancing the security of the plugin<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.5 - 04\\/09\\/2020 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fix: an issue of timeout that occurs when scanning items is now fixed<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: some calls in JS file has been corrected<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: fixing an issue in the general cleanup tab preventing users from deleting orphaned items on WP 5.5<\\/li>\\n<li>Fix: the warning &quot;Deprecated: array_key_exists()&quot; is now solved<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: deleting two scan files generated by the plugin to enhance security<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: we are now using SweetAlert for all popup boxes<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing the JavaScript code<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing some blocks of code<\\/li>\\n<li>Tweak: enhancing the security of the plugin<\\/li>\\n<li>New: you can now scan individual items besides scanning all items<\\/li>\\n<li>New: you can now edit the categorization of items and correct it manually if needed<\\/li>\\n<li>New great features are coming very soon!<\\/li>\\n<li>Tested with WordPress 5.5<\\/li>\\n<li>(Note: When upgrading to this new version, please make sure to clear your browser cache)<\\/li>\\n<\\/ul>\\n<h4> 3.1.0 - 04\\/12\\/2019 <\\/h4>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fix: In some previous versions, tables were not shown for some users.

We do not run any code that can break down your site or delete your posts, pages, comments, etc. However, make sure to always back up your database before any cleanup. This is not optional; it is required! It is always better to be safe than sorry!<\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Optimize my database\\"?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Optimizing your database will reclaim unused space in your tables, which will reduce storage space and improve efficiency when accessing tables. Optimizing the database can sometimes significantly improve performance, particularly on sites that receive a lot of traffic or have a large amount of content. Optimizing your database is absolutely safe.<\\/p>\\n<h4>Is it safe to clean the cron (scheduled tasks)?<\\/h4>\\n<p>A scheduled task enables plugins to execute some actions at specified times, without having to manually execute code at that time. Wordpress itself uses some scheduled tasks to perform some regular actions. However, some scheduled tasks may not be removed even if the responsible plugins are deleted from your WordPress installation. As you know, not all plugins care about the housekeeping of your WordPress. Hence, deleting these unnecessary tasks may help in cleaning your site. It should be noted that cleaning scheduled tasks is safe as long as you know what tasks to clean. If you are not sure, it is better to not clean any task.<\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Revision\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>WordPress stores a record (called &quot;revision&quot;) of each saved draft or published update. This system allows you to see what changes were made in each post and page over time. However, this can lead to a lot of unnecessary overhead in your WordPress database, which consumes a lot of space. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all revisions is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_type = \'revision\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Auto-draft\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Wordpress automatically saves your post\\/page while you are editing it. This is called an auto-draft. If you don\'t hit the publish\\/update button, then the post\\/page will be saved as auto-draft and any modification to your post\\/page will not be visible in your public site. Over time, you could have multiple auto-drafts that you will never publish and hence you can clean them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all auto-drafts is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_status = \'auto-draft\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Pending comment\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Pending comments are comments published by users and which are waiting for your approval before appearing in your site. In some cases, you will have to clean all these comments. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all pending comments is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = \'0\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Spam comment\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>It is a comment that you (or a plugin) have marked as spam. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all spam comments is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = \'spam\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Trash comment\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>A trash comment is a comment that you have deleted from your Wordpress and have been moved to the trash. A trash comment is not visible in your site and should be deleted forever. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all trash comments is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = \'trash\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"trackback\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Trackbacks allows you to notify other websites owners that you have linked to their article on your website. These trackbacks can be used to send huge amounts of spam. Spammers use them to get their links posted on as many sites as possible. That is why they should be deactivated\\/cleaned if you do not use them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean trackbacks is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = \'trackback\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"pingback\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Pingbacks allow you to notify other websites owners that you have linked to their article on your website. Pingbacks were designed to solve some of the problems that people saw with trackbacks. Although there are some minor technical differences, a trackback is basically the same things as a pingback. These pingbacks can be used to send huge amounts of spam. Spammers use them to get their links posted on as many sites as possible. That is why they should be deactivated\\/cleaned if you do not use them. The sql query used by the plugin to clean pingbacks is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = \'pingback\'<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan post meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The post meta data is the information you provide to viewers about each post. This information usually includes the author of the post, when it was written (or posted), and how the author categorized that particular post. In some cases, some post meta data information becomes orphan and does not belong to any post. They are then called &quot;orphan postmeta&quot; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan postmeta is:\\n<code>DELETE pm FROM postmeta pm LEFT JOIN posts wp ON wp.ID = pm.post_id WHERE wp.ID IS NULL<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan comment meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The same as &quot;Orphan post meta&quot; with the exception that &quot;orphan comment meta&quot; concern comments and not posts. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM commentmeta WHERE comment_id NOT IN (SELECT comment_id FROM comments)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan user meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The user meta data is the information you provide to viewers about each user. This information usually includes additional data that is not stored in the users table of WordPress. In some cases, some user meta data information becomes orphaned and does not belong to any user. They are then called &quot;orphaned usermeta&quot; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM usermeta WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT ID FROM users)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan term meta\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>The term meta data is the information that is provided for each taxonomy term. This information usually includes additional data that is not stored in the terms table of WordPress. In some cases, some term meta data information becomes orphaned and does not belong to any taxonomy term. They are then called &quot;orphaned termmeta&quot; and should be cleaned since they are not useful. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan comment meta is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM termmeta WHERE term_id NOT IN (SELECT term_id FROM terms)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"Orphan relationships\\"? What sql code is used to clean it?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Sometimes the wp_term_relationships table becomes bloated with many orphaned relationships. This happens particularly often if you\\u2019re using your site not as a blog but as some other type of content site where posts are deleted periodically. Over time, you could get thousands of term relationships for posts that no longer exist which consumes a lot of database space. The sql query used by the plugin to clean all orphan relationships is:\\n<code>DELETE FROM term_relationships WHERE term_taxonomy_id=1 AND object_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM posts)<\\/code><\\/p>\\n<h4>What does mean \\"expired transient\\"?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Transients are a way of storing cached data in the WordPress DB temporarily by giving it a name and a time frame after which it will expire and be deleted. This helps improve WordPress performance and speed up your website while reducing the overall server load. Expired transients are transients that are expired and still exist in the database. These ones can be safely cleaned. Transients housekeeping is now part of WordPress core, as of version 4.9, so no need to clean up them manually unless you have specific needs.<\\/p>\\n<h4>Is this plugin compatible with multisite?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Yes, it is compatible with multisite. It should be noted that only the main site in the network can clean the database and orphan items of all the network. We prevent other sites to clean your DB since we believe that only the super administrator has the right to perform such operation. Your database is precious!<\\/p>\\n<h4>Is this plugin compatible with SharDB, HyperDB or Multi-DB?<\\/h4>\\n<p>Actually the plugin is not supposed to be compatible with SharDB, HyperDB or Multi-DB. We will try to make it compatible in the coming releases.<\\/p>\\n<h4>Does this plugin cleans itself after the uninstall?<\\/h4>\\n<p>We do clean-up of your WordPress site, it will be a shame if the plugin does not clean itself after an uninstall! Of course yes, the plugin cleans itself and removes any data used to store its settings once uninstalled.<\\/p>\\n"]}',
